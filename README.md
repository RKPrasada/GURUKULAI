## The Problem

12 million+ students appear for RRB/NDA/JEE/NEET every year. Private coaching costs ₹5,000–₹20,000/month — unaffordable for Tier 2/3 families. Gurukul AI is a zero-cost adaptive AI tutor that:

- Identifies each student's exact weak topics (not just "weak in Maths" — "weak in Number System")
- Adapts question difficulty to the student's current level
- Responds in English or Hindi throughout
- Connects students with a human mentor (NAGA) for live classes and Q&A
- Runs weekly Saturday mock tests with LLM-generated question papers
- Tracks progress over time with SM-2 spaced repetition and streak heatmaps
- Has an autonomous AI agent (Dabbu) that proposes interventions — reviewed and approved by NAGA before students see them

## Quick Start

**Only one API key required:** get a free [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) key.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rkprasada/vidyabot
cd vidyabot

# Python backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Add your OPENROUTER_API_KEY to .env

# Start everything
python launcher_react.py        # starts API :8000 + React :3001, opens browser
```

Or start manually:
```bash
# Terminal 1 — FastAPI backend
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 — React frontend (port 3001)
cd web && npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3001 — click **Try Demo** to start without Google login.

## How It Works

### 1. Diagnostic (100 Questions)

Gurukul AI administers a full exam-pattern paper. Questions are generated live by the LLM, split by subject and generated in parallel. Every topic is scored individually — so the weakness map says **"Number System: 20%"** not just "Mathematics: weak".

### 2. Adaptive Study Loop

```
Weakness Map → ContentAgent (study notes) → AssessmentAgent (MCQs at your level)
     ↑                                                   |
     └──────── FeedbackAgent (wrong answer explanations) ┘
```

Difficulty adjusts per session: avg score < 40% → easy, 40–70% → medium, > 70% → hard.

### 3. Dabbu — Autonomous AI Agent

Dabbu watches your progress and proposes actions:
- If you're stagnant on a topic for 2 weeks → proposes a different study approach
- If your SM-2 reviews are overdue → proposes a catch-up session
- If you've been inactive for 7 days → sends an inactivity alert

All Dabbu proposals go through **NAGA** (human mentor) for review before you see them.

### 4. NAGA — Human Mentor

NAGA is a real human mentor role built into the system:
- Approves/amends all Dabbu proposals (study plans, notes, video curation, interventions)
- Posts answers to student questions (purple answer card in UI)
- Schedules group classes with Google Meet links — all enrolled students notified instantly
- Accepts 1-to-1 meeting requests
- Manages the content filter keyword blocklist

Login: `username=naga` / `password=naga@vidyabot` (auto-seeded on startup)

### 5. Weekly Mock Test (Every Saturday 16:00)

- LLM generates a fresh full-length exam paper at 15:00 every Saturday (1 hour advance)
- Students are notified 1 hour before
- Full timed exam UI: countdown timer, section navigation, question navigator grid, autosave every 30s
- Negative marking: all RRB exams −1/3, JEE/NEET −1.0
- Results: score, section breakdown, estimated rank percentile, collapsible answer review with explanations
- Every mock attempt updates the weakness map and feeds the progress tracker

### 6. Progress Tracking

- **60-day streak heatmap** — daily activity calendar
- **SM-2 spaced repetition** — ease factor, interval days, next review date per topic
- **Week-over-week history** — triple bar chart: Initial score / Current score / Target (80%)
- **Study plan completion** — blocks done vs planned
- **Dabbu analysis button** — triggers an AI review of your progress → NAGA-approved intervention
